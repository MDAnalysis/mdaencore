This section contains an overview of the ``mdaencore`` API.
For higher level examples of how to use the software, see the `ENCORE section <https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/stable/examples/analysis/trajectory_similarity/clustering_ensemble_similarity.html>`_ of the MDAnalysis User Guide.
Note that the user guide imports the ENCORE implementation in the core library, as the current version of MDAnalysis still has this functionality.
To use these examples, import ``mdaencore`` rather than ``MDAnalysis.analysis.encore``.
