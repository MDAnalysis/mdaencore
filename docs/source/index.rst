The `mdaencore` MDAKit moves the functionality of integrated ENCORE module out of the MDAnalysis core library, thereby deprecating it in MDAnalysis release 2.7.0 with a planned removal in release 3.0.0.
The original authors for the MDAnalysis implementation of ENCORE are  Matteo Tiberti, Wouter Boomsma, Tone Bengtsen, as well as those listed in ``AUTHORS.md``.
